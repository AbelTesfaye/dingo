- UI
    - settings tab (fully customizable, auto-generated using JSON objects)
        - image loading and splash screen can be disabled 

    - search bar
        - play url if YouTube url is searched
        - added search history and suggestions

    - aesthetics
        - player
            - vector icons

        - tab bar is now at the bottom

        - for emphasized items, it's cleaner to use darker text instead of bold

        - curved image borders (the spice that made it look so good!)

        
- history library
    - audio loads much faster if track is picked from history
